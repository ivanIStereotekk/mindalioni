# Mindalioni Technopolis

> "We can only rely on what offers resistance."
> â€” Henri Beyle (Stendhal), "The Red and the Black"

## Preamble

In April 2025, Georgia stands at a crossroads. On one hand, the country's economy demonstrates sustainable growth (GDP of approximately $20 billion, with an annual growth of 6-8% according to IMF data), its geopolitical position offers opportunities, and its cultural heritage remains a rich resource. However, dependence on imported technologies, poverty (16% of the population according to 2023 data), and the continuous outflow of young people impede the country's development.

### Current Challenges

- Political instability and protests of 2024-25
- Division between ruling elites and society
- Youth demanding new opportunities
- Older generation seeking to preserve traditions
- Global challenges including digitalization and climate crisis
- Increasing technological gap with leading nations

### The Need for Change

The technopolis project should rely on progressive youth demanding change and renewal as the key driving force. The proposed model of technopolis self-governance with a system of open majoritarian voting on all significant issues will allow the younger generation to influence the project's implementation.

### Key Features

- Free education with high scholarships ($400-700/month)
- Diverse public initiatives
- Vibrant ecosystem for 5000-6000 students
- Industrial clusters (1200-3000 jobs)
- Startup accelerator with research grants ($50,000-100,000)

### Public Support and Transparency

Transparency of structure and control of spent funds, embedded in the project's foundation, can convince the public of the openness of intentions. The provisional name "Mindalioni" could become a symbol of youth aspirations.

### Information Campaign

- Social media presence (#MindalioniFuture)
- Popularization of the technopolis brand
- Public speeches by authoritative figures
- Support from the Orthodox Church

This project represents an opportunity for every citizen of Georgia to contribute to the future of the country, relying on its intellectual potential and spiritual traditions.
